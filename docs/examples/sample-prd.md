## 👥 User Stories

### Core User Stories:
1. **As a** team member, **I want** to create and assign tasks, **so that** work is clearly distributed
2. **As a** project manager, **I want** to view team progress in real-time, **so that** I can identify blockers early

- Integration with external calendar systems (future consideration)
- AI-powered task suggestions
- Offline functionality (web-only for MVP)
- Custom workflow automation

## 🛠️ Technical Considerations
- **Technology Stack**: 
  - Frontend: React with TypeScript, TailwindCSS
  - Backend: Node.js with Express, Socket.io for real-time features
  - Database: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
  - Authentication: JWT with refresh tokens
- **Architecture Pattern**: Microservices with API Gateway
- **Performance Requirements**: 
  - <2s initial page load
  - <500ms for task operations
  - Support 1000+ concurrent users
- **Security Considerations**: 
  - HTTPS only, input validation, SQL injection prevention
  - Rate limiting, CORS configuration
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling capability, database read replicas

## 📊 Success Metrics

  - Daily active users: 70% of registered users
  - Average session duration: >10 minutes
  - Task completion rate: >80%
- **Performance**: 
  - Page load time: <2s (95th percentile)
  - API response time: <200ms (average)
  - Uptime: 99.5%
- **Quality**:

## ❓ Open Questions
1. Should we support file attachments on tasks in MVP?
2. What's the maximum team size we need to support?
3. Do we need integration with Slack/Teams for notifications?
4. Should task templates be included in MVP?

  - User auth, basic task CRUD, dashboard views
- **Phase 2**: Collaboration features (3 weeks)  
  - Real-time updates, comments, team management
- **Phase 3**: Polish and analytics (2 weeks)
  - Performance optimization, basic reporting

## 🔗 Dependencies
